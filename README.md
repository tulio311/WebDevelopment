## Coffee

The Coffee folder contains a web page in which I calculate the amount of spoons and coffee grains that I need in order to make a determined amount of coffee milimiters with a selected amount of 
coffee grams per 200 ml of water. The options are those of the coffee varieties I had at the moment I created the page. I weighted the filled spoon and grain average in each variety in order to
make the correct calculations. At the bottom of the page I added the time that I have to wait in minutes for different amount of mililiters of water till that water gets hot. I have 2 numbers 
because the time varies if the door that is beside the stove is open.

## Music

The music folder contains a personal database which contains the music that I know organized by artist and then by album (It does not contain absolutely everything that I know but I continuously update it). The albums that I know completely are marked with green. It has been built with JQuery.

# Data

The Data folder contains a tree shaped notes that I've made in the topic of data science. I found it useful to make notes in this shape in some knowledge areas. Not all knowledge is linear and therefore not all knowledge can be optimally structured in this way. In this notes you can press whatever title or paragraph that changes color when you hover it. When you do that, it carries you to a more extended explanation of the thing, this is where the tree shape comes in. I use a yellow like color to mark questions or topics I haven't researched. I like to add these things to remember that things exist and learn about them later.
