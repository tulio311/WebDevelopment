The Coffee folder contains a web page in which I calculate the amount of spoons and coffee grains that I need in order to make a determined amount of coffee milimiters with a selected amount of 
coffee grams per 200 ml of water. The options are those of the coffee varieties I had at the moment I created the page. I weighted the filled spoon and grain average in each variety in order to
make the correct calculations. At the bottom of the page I added the time that I have to wait in minutes for different amount of mililiters of water till that water gets hot. I have 2 numbers 
because the time varies if the door that is beside the stove is open.


The music folder contains a personal database which contains the music that I know organized by artist and then by album (Not absolutely everything but I continuously update it). The albums that I know completely are marked with green. It has been built with JQuery.


Both projects have responsive design for the case of cellphones.
